# Advanced FPGA & SoC Projects

This repository contains a curated set of FPGA and SoC projects that I personally implemented, focusing on accelerator design, system integration, and hardware–software co-design.

All projects in this repository are hands-on implementations and verification results produced by myself. Course slides or reference materials are intentionally excluded to keep the repository engineering-focused.

## Project Overview

| Category | Projects |
|--------|---------|
| DSP / Math Accelerators | FIR Filter, CORDIC |
| Compute Accelerators | Dense Matrix Multiplication, Sparse Matrix Multiplication |
| System Validation | AXI Stream, AXI VIP, ILA |
| SoC Integration | Blink IP on Vitis |

## Toolchain
- Vivado / Vivado HLS
- Vitis
- AXI (Lite / Stream), AXI VIP
- Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA)
- Zynq SoC

Each project folder contains implementation files and validation results generated during development.
