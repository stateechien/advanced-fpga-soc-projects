# Sparse Matrix Multiplication Accelerator

This project explores sparse matrix multiplication using the CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) format.

## Objectives
- Implement sparse matrix multiplication in hardware
- Compare direct CSR computation with adapter-based approaches
- Analyze architectural trade-offs

## Key Features
- CSR data structure handling
- Multiple architectural approaches
- Design space exploration

## Verification
- Testbench-based functional validation
- Synthesis report comparison

## Takeaways
Sparse computation introduces control complexity, and architecture selection significantly impacts performance and reuse.
